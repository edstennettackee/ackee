Personal site for displaying portfolio work for Ed Stennett
You will need node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm installed before starting work `sudo npm install npm -g`.
Once installed, open Terminal and `git clone` the site in a folder of your choice. To install the site, run `npm install` - this will install the dependencies from the package.json and open up Chrome. Changes made will live update.
